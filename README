WHAT IS IT?
-----------
This set of modules provides Solaris-specific functionality, mainly related to
obtaining performance and configuration information from the Operating System.
The following modules are provided:

Solaris::MapDev
Maps between device instance names and /dev names, e.g. "sd0" to "c0t0d0" and
vice-versa.

Solaris::Kstat
Provides access to the kernel performance statistics via the Solaris kstat
interface - see 'man kstat' for details.  The kernel statistics are represented
as a set of nested perl hashes.

The following modules are under development:

Solaris::Kmem
Read values from the running kernel.

Solaris::MIB
Access STREAMS network statistics

Solaris::NDD
Access network device statistics

PREREQUISITES
-------------
1.  Perl 5.004_05 or later
    Perl 5.004_04 has several bugs that prevent this package from working
3.  Solaris 2.5.1 or later
2.  A C compiler

INSTALLATION
------------
1.  Check you have all the prequisites installed and working.
2.  Run 'perl Makefile.PL && make test'

HOW TO USE
----------
There are man pages for all the modules - after installation try 'man
Solaris::Kstat' and 'man Solaris::MapDev' for full details.

There are also a few example scripts provided, which will be installed into the
same directory as your perl executable.  These are:

dump_kstats	Dumps the entire kstat tree to stdout
iost+		Replacement for iostat with better statistics
mapdev          Maps between device instances and names (eg sdNN to cNtNdN)
show_devs	Show all disk device serial numbers & manufacturer information
